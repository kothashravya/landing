    <h3>About the UPHCs</h3>
<p>
  The Primary Healthcare Center (PHC) is the basic structural and functional unit of the public
      health services in developing countries. PHCs were established to provide accessible, affordable
      and available primary health care to people, in accordance with the Alma Ata Declaration of 1978
      by the member nations of the World Health Organisation WHO.

<p>
n South Asia, PHCs are the basic first-line units providing primary health care.
Theoretically, there is one PHC for every 30,000 of population. Each PHC has five
or six sub-centres staffed by health workers for outreach services such as immunization,
basic curative care services, and maternal and child health services and preventive services.
PHCs generally consist of one or more doctors to lead the centre and a pharmacist, staff
nurse, and other paramedical support staff. GOBI-FFF is a model of a PHC.
